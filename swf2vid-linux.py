# swf2vid for linux. Copyright Â© 2011 Justin Boisvert, Zac Sturgeon, Alec Gorge
# Requires swftool, Python 2.6.*, gnash, ffmpeg (tested against gnash 0.8.[8-9dev] and ffmpeg SVN-r23418)

# Have a bit of cleaning up to do.
# Can only run one instance at a time right now because I'm a little lazy with the paths.
# Frames should be written to /tmp for best performance.  Not everyone's /home is big enough
# on some systems.  Alec's Shell forks don't pass the correct arguments for some reason.
# I changed them back to os.system() because shell exploits aren't very useful on a local desktop.
# We'll need to change this if we write a CGI version, but for now this works.
